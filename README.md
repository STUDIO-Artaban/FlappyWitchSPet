Here is the story...

Once upon a time, during a sumptuous ball organized by an unknown charming prince, was a little witch who pushed a bit hard on the drin... was bewitched! Being unable to go home by her own means, she was grudgingly forced to let her pet bring her back home.

Unfortunately, her pet had also booz... had been bewitched as well!

Help our two fellows, totaly... bewitched, going back home safe.

**NB:** Do not play FLAPPY Witch's Pet under the influence of spirit... BEWITCHED YOU KNOW!
